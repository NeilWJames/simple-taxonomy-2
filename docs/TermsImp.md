# Terms import

This tool allows terms to be entered in bulk into a taxonomy.

The user selects the Taxonomy and also whether the data to be entered as non-hierarchical, hierarchical with leading spaces or tabs.  

For the hierarchical data entry, the number of spaces or tabs denote the hierarchy. Clearly the number of leading spaces or tabs can only br one greater than the immediately preceding line. 

Finally there is a text area where the terms are entered.

The terms are entered one per line. For hierarchical taxonomies it may be necessary to  enter existing terms in order to give the correct context for a sub-term to be entered. Existing term will not be updated.

As only term text is entered, the slug is generated from the term text and no description is created.

This data can be entered or amended in the appropriate Taxonomy maintenance screen. 

See the [example page](./example.md) for a specific example of the function usage.
