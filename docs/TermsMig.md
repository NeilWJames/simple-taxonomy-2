# Terms migrate

This tool enables terms to be copied from one Taxonomy to another within the database.

The user selects the Source and Destination taxonomies - which may be standard (built-in) or custom ones.

Once selected the entire set of terms held in the Source taxonomy are extracted and entered into the screen ready for loading with the [Terms Import](./TermsImp.md) function.

This gives the opportunity to edit this list to choose subsets, etc.

If both of these are Hierarchical, then the terms will be output in a format to be loaded as a Hierarchy, otherwise a simple list will be produced.
