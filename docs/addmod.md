# Add/Modify a Taxonomy

The main purpose of the plug-in is to set the very many parameters available to the user when defining a Taxonomy.

They are all set within this section.

Because there are so many rather than supporting a very large page, the window has been divided into a number of panels.

The names, in English, associated with the fields correspond to the variables that are being set. There is no point here second guessing the usage or purpose of the parameters.

See the [WordPress Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy/) for their detail.

## Main

The name **must** be completed in order to add the taxonomy.

The last field *Display Terms with Posts* is not related to a parameter. It allows you to request that the taxonomy terms added to posts are displayed with the post content and/or excerpt.
